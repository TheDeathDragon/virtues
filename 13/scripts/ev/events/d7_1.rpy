    player "Zzz Zzz Zzz..."

    c_qm "Waaaaaaake uuuuuuuup."

    player "Hmm?!?"

    narrator "What the hell? Who's there? Is Theodora in my room again? This is the second time this week. Damn it, I can't stand it anymore. I swear I will..."

    player "Eh?"

    narrator "I opened my eyes."

    narrator "I didn't find Theodora in my sight. Instead, I saw a different girl lying on my bed. She looks just like Theodora's younger version. They both have emerald pupils and silver hair, but they are not the same person."

    narrator "I know who she is."

    player "Irene?"

    d "Ah! You are finally awake, [P.name]."

    narrator "This is Irene, Theodora's little sister. They look similar, but their personalities are remarkably different. Unlike her bad-temper older sister, Irene seems sweet and cute. She and I are very close since we were kids."

    narrator "Maybe... a little bit too close? I mean, she is now lying on the same bed with me and acts like nothing happened."

    player "Eh, why are you on my bed?"

    scene day7_d2 with tstmgr

    d "Just like what we did when we were small. Don't you miss it?"

    player "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "When we were young, she loved to come to my home and play with me. Sometimes we would share the same bed at night, and I would scare her with ghost stories. That was really a splendid memory."

    narrator "But now things have become weird. I mean, both of us have grown up. It is inappropriate for us to sleep together anymore, not to mention that I have already engaged with her sister."

    scene day7_d1 with tstmgr

    d " What's wrong?"

    player "You see, Irene, sharing bed is kind of inappropriate for us now since we are not kids anymore."

    narrator "Do I really think that is inappropriate? Ha, not at all. No man would ever refuse to sleep on the same bed with an adorable girl like Irene."

    narrator "But I took her as my own sister. I have to say what I have to say."

    scene day7_d3 with tstmgr

    d "What? You don't like me being with you?"

    player "No, absolutely no. But you have grown up..."

    scene day7_d2 with tstmgr

    d "No, I haven't yet."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    scene day7_d4 with tstmgr

    narrator "Well, no matter how she denies it, her increasing breast size has proved everything. Although her tits are not as marvelous as her sister yet, I am still optimistic about her potential."

    narrator "These two adorable titties are right in front of my hands. If I touch them now..."

    narrator "Irene has never said no to my requests before. And for God's sake, she is now lying on my bed without any protection."

    player "... ... ... ..."

    scene day7_d1 with tstmgr

    player "(Nope, I can't do such things.)"

    player "(She lies on my bed because she trusts me and still takes me as a reliable big brother. I can't let her down.)"

    player "(... ... ... ...)"

    player "(And now, let's take this as a test of my endurance...)"

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "Ah... those pretty legs and that cute panty..."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "Wait, something is not right."

    narrator "My penis is getting harder every second..."

    narrator "It's not my fault. This girl is lying on my bed and revealing her underwear. Every healthy man would have an erection in this situation."

    scene day7_d2 with tstmgr

    d "Hah?"

    narrator "Oh, no. She noticed it."

    narrator "Irene came near me like a little snake. She seems to be curious about the change in my body."

    scene day7_d6 with tstmgr

    d "Why does it swell up..."

    d "Are you sick?"

    player "(Awkward) Ha... No, I can... I can explain..."

    d "... ... ... ..."

    scene day7_d7 with tstmgr

    d "Are you heating up because of me?"

    player "Eh, well, about that... That's just a regular physiological change calls “Morning Wood.” Haven't you heard of it at your phsiology class?"

    narrator "Morning wood? How did I come up with that so quickly? I'm such a genius."

    scene day7_d8 with tstmgr

    d "Morning... wood?"

    player "Yes. Every grown male would get his morning wood every day. It's a signal of being healthy. That's all."

    d "So... It's not because of me?"

    narrator "Great, she believed in what I told."

    player "No, of course not."

    d "... ... ... ..."

    scene day7_d9 with tstmgr

    d "Are you sure of that?"

    player "Yes, I'm absolutely sure. There is no way for me to have sexual responses to you."

    scene day7_d10 with tstmgr

    d "I hate you! I don't want to talk to you anymore!!!"

    scene hotelroom1_background with tstmgr

    narrator "She got up from the bed of a sudden, and then stormed out of my room."

    player "(What just happened?)"

    player "(Why did she piss off? I was just trying to act like a virtuous big brother.)"

    player "... ... ... ..."

    player "(I don't even know why she showed up in my room in the first place.)"

    player "Weird..."

    player "That was the third girl I pissed off this week. Ah... I'm getting used to it now."

    scene hoteldoor_background with tstmgr

    narrator "Suddenly, I heard someone is opening the door."

    player "(Is she coming back?)"

    player "Hey, listen, Irene. I am sorry about......"

    player "Oh..."

    scene day2_c1 with tstmgr

    narrator "The person who stands at the door is not Irene, but Theodora."

    c "What did you do to that little imp? She looks angry."

    player "There was a minor mistake..."

    c "Ah, I don't even want to know. Just get on your clothes and go with me."

    player "go where?"

    c "My mom is holding a family picnic today, and she wants you to come, too."

    c "I texted you about this last night, didn't you receive it?"

    player "(Awkward) Oh..."

    narrator "I didn’t get her text, because I had already put her number on my blacklist since the last time when we had a quarrel. Now I can't receive anything from her."

    c "Did you put me on the blacklist?"

    player "How did you... Shit..."

    player "Sorry."

    c "It doesn't matter. Your number was on my blacklist, too. And I just removed it from that list yesterday to text you."

    player "(Awkward) Ha..."

    c "Anyway, hurry up. You don't want to let my mom wait too long."

    player "Okay, okay."

    narrator "... ... ... ..."

    narrator "I stayed with Theodora's family for the rest of today."
