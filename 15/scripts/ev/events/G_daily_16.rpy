    "Evening, in uno’s room..."



    scene g_daily16_1 with dissolve

    "Uno is kneeling at my feet obediently, enjoying my touch like a tame cat."



    g "Purrrrrr~~~ This is always the best part of my day~"



    "Well, it is my best part of the day as well."



    player "Uno, I think you have never told me anything about your family, have you?"



    scene g_daily16_2 with tstmgr

    g "Uh-huh... ..."



    player "So... do you want to talk about it?"



    scene g_daily16_3 with tstmgr

    g "I’m just a pet of yours. You don’t need to know about a pet’s family~"



    player "Eh... I know it is kind of your life goal to be a pet and I’m happy to do this roleplay with you too, but... ..."



    scene g_daily16_4 with tstmgr

    player "You know you mean more than just a pet to me, right. You are the love of my life, I mean, one of the loves of my life."



    player "And I think it’s essential for me to know about my love’s family, don’t you think? Maybe I should pay a visit or something."



    scene g_daily16_5 with tstmgr

    g "... ... ... ..."



    g "I don’t... have a family."



    scene g_daily16_6 with tstmgr

    g "I mean, my biological parents, they abandoned me after I was born and I never knew who they were and what they looked like. I grew up in a group home but it never felt like a home to me."



    scene g_daily16_7 with tstmgr

    player "Shit, what? Oh honey, I’m so sorry to hear that."



    scene g_daily16_8 with tstmgr

    g "There is no need to feel sorry for me. I didn’t think I was miserable or anything. I didn’t know what it is like to have a family, so I didn’t feel bad for not having it."



    scene g_daily16_9 with tstmgr

    g "But during my years in the group home, I was desperately curious about the concept of family. I always wanted to have a shelter... and someone that I can fully rely on."



    g "That’s when I started to want to be a pet and find myself an ‘owner’. In my opinion, an ‘owner’ is like a combination of a parent and a lover... which are the things I never had before."



    player "I see... ..."



    scene g_daily16_10 with tstmgr

    g "And I’m so happy that I found you, master~ You are the most perfect owner!"



    scene g_daily16_11 with tstmgr

    player "It’s kinda weird to know that you take me as a half father though, but I can understand that. If that can make you feel more secure, so be it~"



    scene g_daily16_12 with tstmgr

    g "Although I didn’t have a real father in my life, I have found the best choice of father for my future kid~"



    g "Master will be the best father ever!~"



    player "It’s... a little bit too early to think about that now... ..."



    g "But we will have kids, right, master?"



    player "I... I guess so, yes~"



    scene g_daily16_13 with tstmgr

    g "Master~~ master~~ hee hee, love you~~"
